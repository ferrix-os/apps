"""Generate the terminal's font from the Hack TrueType faces.

The panic screen's font (`tools/common/gen/gen-font.py`) is an 8x16 bitmap, because a
panic has no filesystem to load a font from and every byte it costs is a byte
of kernel image. The terminal is a different program with a different problem:
it is what a person actually reads, for as long as they are logged in, and a
bitmap font designed for a 1990s console is what makes an otherwise finished
desktop look like one.

So the terminal carries its own font: Hack, rendered from its TrueType
outlines at 20 pixels per em into a 12x24 cell with one coverage byte a pixel.
Antialiasing is the whole point -- a stem that falls between two pixels is two
grey pixels rather than one black one snapped to the grid -- and coverage is
what `paint.rs` blends the foreground and background colours with.

The outlines are rasterised here, not by FreeType, and nothing in this file
imports anything that is not in the standard library. A gate that needs a pip
install is a gate that does not run on a stock checkout, and this one has to
run in CI: the output is committed, `--check` regenerates it into memory and
compares, and byte-identical is only a meaningful demand if every machine's
rasteriser is this one. The price is that the TrueType hinting programs are
ignored, which is what every modern renderer at this size does anyway.

What identifies the input is its SHA-256, embedded in the header along with
the family, version and copyright read from the font's own `name` table, so
that an updated face cannot leave a stale credit behind.

The licence travels with the fonts in `LICENSE-hack`.

Usage:
    python3 tools/gen-font.py           # write the output, in the term app
    python3 tools/gen-font.py --check   # fail if it is stale
